# 03 - CSS Variables

## Project Meta Information
---
* Status: COMPLETE


### Motivation: Why CSS Variables vs SASS Variables?

CSS variables can be changed by JS

SASS variables exist before trans-compilation, as it gets compiled down to CSS. Therefore, they cannot be changed by JS


## Things Learned
---
1. New `<input>` types
    - `type="range"`
    - `type="color"`
2. `dataset` attribute on HTMLElements
    - Dictionary of all data attributes attached to an element
    - If `data-attrOne` is a data attribute for an element, `attrOne` will be an attribute in that element's `dataset`
3. Changing CSS variables in JS
